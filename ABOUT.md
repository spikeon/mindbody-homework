This project was created for the hiring process for Mindbody in SLO, CA.

I was provided with a static image, an API url, and a week.  I completed
the project and turned it in within three days.

Since creating this, I now see many faults in how I created it.  I have
since learned many new technologies and I am tempted to re-write this
in one of them.  If I do I will add it to the portfolio
